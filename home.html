    <h3><a href="https://scholarplusplus.org/" target="_blank">Scholar++</a></h3>

    <p>Scholar++ is a web application designed to act as a search engine for research data using the OpenAlex API. The main goal of the application is to allow users to tailor their searches to their needs with a variety of filters, enabling searches to be as broad or narrow as necessary. Built in Python with the Django web framework, Scholar++ can be accessed from any device with a web browser, including mobile devices.</p>
